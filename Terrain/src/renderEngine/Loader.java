	/**
	 * Stores the position data of the vertices into attribute 0 of the VAO. To
	 * do this the positions must first be stored in a VBO. You can simply think
	 * of a VBO as an array of data that is stored in memory on the GPU for easy
	 * access during rendering.
	 * 
	 * Just like with the VAO, we create a new VBO using a "gen" method, and
	 * make it the active VBO (so that we do stuff to it) by binding it.
	 * 
	 * We then store the positions data in the active VBO by using the
	 * glBufferData method. We also indicate using GL_STATIC_DRAW that this data
	 * won't need to be changed. If we wanted to edit the positions every frame
	 * (perhaps to animate the quad) then we would use GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW instead.
	 * 
	 * We the connect the VBO to the VAO using the glVertexAttribPointer()
	 * method. This needs to know the attribute number of the VAO where we want
	 * to put the data, the number of floats used for each vertex (3 floats in
	 * this case, because each vertex has a 3D position, an x, y, and z value),
	 * the type of data (in this case we used floats) and then some other more
	 * complicated stuff for storing the data in more fancy ways. Don't worry
	 * about the last 3 parameters for now, we don't need them here.
	 * 
	 * Now that we've finished using the VBO we can unbind it. This isn't
	 * totally necessary, but I think it's good practice to unbind the VBO when
	 * you're done using it.
	 * 
	 * @param attributeNumber
	 *            - The number of the attribute of the VAO where the data is to
	 *            be stored.
	 * @param data
	 *            - The geometry data to be stored in the VAO, in this case the
	 *            positions of the vertices.

	 * IntBuffer.

	 * First and empty buffer of the correct size is created. You can think of a

	 * the first empty element of the array. This is so that we could add more
