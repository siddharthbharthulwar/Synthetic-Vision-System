# Synthetic-Vision-System
 Intel Science and Engineering Fair 2020 Submission. Currently a work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a navigational and visual aid for commercial pilots landing in low visibility conditions. The first part of the project consists of parsing geospatial LiDAR data into 3d objects through a novel thresholding technique. The aggregated spatial data will then be used to generate synthetic imagery replicating the environment surrounding the aircraft. Data from other sources (ADS-B and inertial data from the cockpit) will be visualized as well. The first part of the project will be written in Python 3.6 and the second part will use Modern OpenGL from the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL 2) in Java.
