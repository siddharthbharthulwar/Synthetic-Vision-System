# Synthetic-Vision-System
 Intel Science and Engineering Fair 2020 Submission. Currently a work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a navigational and visual aid for commercial pilots landing in low visibility conditions. The first part of the project consists of parsing geospatial LiDAR data into 3d objects through either a convolutional neural network or similar thresholding techniques. The second part of this project is to construct a 3d environment of the surroundings of the aircraft based on the previously generated 3d models. This environment should closely mirror the pilot's realtime perspective. The first part of the project will be created in Python 3.6 but the second part will most likely be created in Java's Lightweight Open GL Framework(LWJGL).
