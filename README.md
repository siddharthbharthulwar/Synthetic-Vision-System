# Synthetic-Vision-System
 Intel Science and Engineering Fair 2020 Submission. Currently a work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a navigational and visual aid for commercial pilots landing in low visibility conditions. The first part of the project consists of parsing geospatial LiDAR data into 3d objects through machine learning and a convolutional neural network. The second part of the project is to construct a physical apparatus that projects the 3d environment onto a cockpit window to replicate the perspective of a pilot. This tool will be used in conjunction with ILS to decrease likelihood go-arounds and diversions during low visibility conditions, as well as increasing traffic volume during poor conditions with lower separation restrictions. The first phase of the project is planned to be completed in Python, but the second phase will either be in C++ OpenGL or something similar. One plan is to use Cython in conjunction with OpenGL C++ to unify the entire project to Python.
